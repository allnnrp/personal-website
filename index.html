			<h2>If you want to see mother nature's handiwork at its finest, this is where you should go. As the name suggests, these rocks have been carved out by the sea to their present umbrella-esque shape. These peculiarly-shaped rock formations that line the shore of Agno's Sabangan beach are beautiful at any time of the day, but the sight of them at sunrise is especially striking; so drag yourself out of bed if you have to. Nearby, there is also a lighthouse that offers you a birds-eye view of the beach, as well as a glimpse of the Umbrella rocks from above.<br><br><br>
			
			<i>Open</i>:	Everyday, 6am-6pm.<br>
			<i>Address</i>:	Sitio Abagatanen Macaboboni Agno, Pangasinan<br>

			<h1>Bangol Crags</h1><br><br><br>
			<h2>The rough and rugged landscape provided by the Bangol Crags make for a particularly cinematic backdrop for photographs which is what many people flock to these rock formations for. On most days, the waves will be smashing dramatically against the crags, but even when the waters are calm, they are a sight to behold and a good stretch of the muscles for anyone hankering for physical activity. The crags are also a prime spot for sunset-viewing so make sure to head there before the sun goes down.

			<h1>St. Catherine of Alexandria Parish</h1><br><br><br>
			<h2>The air is instantly cooler inside this centuries-old church, not because of air-conditioning, obviously, but because of its incredibly thick stone walls that confirm its age. Religious tourists will undoubtedly be compelled to reverence once inside the ancient church with its high ceilings and quiet elegance. But eve the non-religious will find interest in the structure's architectural features. Those who would like to see more of the church should go outside its main halls. Outside, the original structure, though covered in vines, still stands to reveal just how big the parish was when it was originally built.
